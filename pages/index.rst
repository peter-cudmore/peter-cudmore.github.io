I'm a mathematician and member of the `Systems Biology Lab`_ at
`The University of Melbourne`_, Australia.

I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from `The University of Queensland`_, Australia.
Under the supervision of Dr. Cathy Holmes, Dr. `Cecilia Gonzalez Tokman`_ and
Prof. `Joseph Grotowski`_.

I'm fundamentally interested understanding the principals of complex and
networked systems in order to predict, measure and control emergent phenomenon,
and how such principals can be applied to engineer solutions to real world
problems in biology, physics, technology, engineering, finance and a variety of
other networked systems.

After my doctoral studies I had the opportunity to work in a financial tech
startup as a software developer and financial engineer. Short though the stint
was, I learnt much about the software development process and the practical
aspects of working with a diverse team of business leaders, consultants,
analysts and other software engineers.

I was fortunate enough to find my current role where I am working under the
guidance of Prof. `Edmund Crampin`_ to develop network based engineering tools
for Synthetic and Systems Biology as part of the `ARC Centre of Excellence in Convergent Bio-Nano Science & Technology`_ (CBNS).
